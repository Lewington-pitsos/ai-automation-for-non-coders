1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 This will save you personally 100 minutes every single week,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,333
 as long as you are a knowledge worker who sends emails regularly.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,350
 This is me answering the exact same email, a real

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,900
email I actually received, in two different ways.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,900
 Above, you see me typing out the response word by word,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,900
and below, you see the brain dump method, which is where you

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,800
use dictation software to very loosely say what you want,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,900
 turn that into text, give the text to a large language model, and then

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,900
have the large language model craft a nice email for you, which you

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,733
then copy paste into your actual email client and then do a final pass.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,900
 I type at 80 to 90 words per minute, which is considered fairly fast, but

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,800
even so, the brain dump method is still about two times as fast as that.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,850
 And more importantly, it's also a lot more enjoyable, since

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,900
typing fast and without errors is quite mentally strenuous.
- and you're bound to make some errors anyway.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,900
 You're going to need two things.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,900
 A subscription to Claude or Chat GPT or something similar to that,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,900
 and a MacBook.  This will work on any MacBook.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,733
 All you have to do is open up the settings.  Then search for dictation.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,900
 It'll bring up this like keyboard dictation menu.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,850
 And then you scroll down and then all you have

21
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,900
to do is make sure that this thing is toggled on.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,900
 Probably also set the language to whatever your language is.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,850
 Now that dictation is enabled, whenever we press control twice, the

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,900
computer will pick up our voice and enter that as if we were typing.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,600
 So, press control twice.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,900
 Claude, I want you to start writing an email for me.  And here we go.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,533
 We're off to the races.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,900
 The only important thing to remember here is that at the

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,900
end of your email, when you've said, hey, I want you to

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,933
say this, that, and the other, you add dash dash dash dash,

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,866
 make this into a nice draft.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,900
 email for me.  And then you press enter.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,900
 But the quickness isn't even the main advantage in my opinion.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,200
 The main advantage is that it is a lot more fun.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,066
 So give it a go.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,900
 Definitely try it out.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,900
 And something else to try out if you're in Melbourne

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,900
 is my course where we are going to teach you to automate more of your

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,400
workflow using more sophisticated tools than just voice recording.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,900
 And rather than saving you 100 minutes a week, hopefully

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,900
we'll save you something closer to 200, 300 minutes a week.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,900
 15 seats, check it out, apply now.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,900
 If you're not in Melbourne though, you can't attend.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,400
 So maybe something you want to look into is this other course,

45
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,900
which is a free online course that I did with IT Masters called

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,400
practical AI for non-coders, which goes over some of the

47
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,833
theoretical aspects of AI for someone who isn't technical at all.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,800
 Very cool, very great online course.
- But everyone who watches this video has to

49
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,833
try this audio email pipeline at least once.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,500
 It has changed my life and it takes less

51
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,200
than five minutes to set up and test.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,466
 So, you have to do it.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,133
 It is now incumbent upon you to do it
at least once with one email this week.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,200
 And if you're not going to do it, then you have to tell me why.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,900
 You have to give me your excuse and it better be a a really good one.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,900
 If it's not a good excuse, I'm I'm
unfollowing, I'm disconnecting from you.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,266
 Those are the rules, okay?  You have to try it.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,933
 And it'll save you a lot of your life and it'll be awesome.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,333
 Those are the rules.
