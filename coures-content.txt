motivation/inspiration


There has been a fundamental change in software projects. 

For every project there are two components, the software expertise and the understanding of the problem

In the past writing software took a huge amount of experience, so it was always better for a developer to come in and learn the problem, then build a solution

Now code is very easy to write, so proportionally the understanding of the problem becomes more important.

That’s the goal: to empower the people who understand the problem deeply, who live with it every day, to solve it themselves



A.I. Automation For Non-Coders: Cohort 01

Welcome to A.I. Automation for Non-Coders. the goal of this 2 week part time course is to teach you how to use low-code automation tools like n8n to automate repetative processes in your business. By the end of the course each of you you will have Created one workflow in n8n which is actually working in production, saving you hours every week. 

You will also learn:

- What a neural network is
- How A.I. is changing how we work
- What it means to "deploy" a solution
- Basic cybersecurity practices


Course timeline

2 Days of in person hacking and 2 assistance sessions, 14.5 hours total

- Saturday 27th September 1000-1630 -> introduction day, theory of A.I., understanding deployment, we all code an automation together, you pick something to automate at work and we help. Catered lunch
- Tuesday 30th September -> 1700-1830 check in session, practical assistance given to help your automation
- Thursday 2nd October -> 1700-1830 check in session, practical assistance given to help your automation
- Saturday 4th October -> 1000-1430 -> coding assistance, brainstorming problems in teams, important cybersecurity practices, how A.I. is changing how we work, Catered Lunch

Each cohort is given a social group to stay in touch and support each other
Access to alumni network

Course Details

CBD location, TBD
27th September-4th October
