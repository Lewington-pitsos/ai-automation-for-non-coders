Hero Section: The Revolution Has Already Started
There's been a fundamental shift in how software gets built, and most people haven't noticed yet.
For decades, creating software required years of specialized training. Companies hired consultants for $400 an hour to learn their problems and then solve them. It made sense—coding was the hard part. But that equation has flipped completely. Today, creating software, be it through writing code with A.I. assistance or using a low-code platform is so easy that understanding the problem deeply is the true differentiator. The people who live with these problems every day, who understand every nuance and edge case, who feel the friction—these are the people who should be building solutions in the age of A.I.
That's exactly what we're going to teach in this course.

Welcome to A.I. Automation for Non-Coders, where we're empowering the real experts—the ones who actually understand the problems—to solve them directly.

Your Journey from Manual to Automated
Who This Course Is For
You're drowning in repetitive tasks that eat away at your real work. Maybe you're:

A small business owner watching hours disappear into invoice processing, data entry, and customer communications.
An operations manager manually pulling data from five different systems every Monday morning to create the same report.
A marketing professional copy-pasting campaign results from Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn into spreadsheets, knowing there must be a better way
An HR team member reading through hundreds of applications, extracting the same information, updating the same tracking sheets
Anyone who's ever thought "there has to be a better way" while doing the same computer task for the hundredth time

If you're spending more than 5 hours a week on repetitive computer tasks, you're not just wasting time—you're hemorrhaging money. At $50 an hour, that's $13,000 annually spent on work a computer could do in seconds. But you don't need to hire a developer or wait for IT to build you a solution. You can build it yourself, right now, starting with this course.

## What You'll Actually Build

Forget vague promises about "digital transformation." Here's what real non-technical specialists have automated with low-code tools:

- **Account recovery workflows that save 200 hours monthly**—like [Delivery Hero's IT automation](https://n8n.io/case-studies/delivery-hero/) that reduced employee lockout time from 35 to 20 minutes, freeing up thousands of work hours annually

- **Invoice processing that transforms 3-day tasks into 45 minutes**—[Rich Nasser automated his friend's entire invoicing workflow](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-automated-friends-invoicing-process-one-weekend-rich-nasser) using Power Automate's AI over a single weekend, extracting data from PDFs and automatically routing invoices to the correct recipients

- **Contract automation that scales six-figure businesses**—[Bordr's relocation services](https://n8n.io/case-studies/bordr/) went from side project to thriving business by automating PDF contract generation, client communications, and payment processing through n8n workflows

- **Release notes generation that eliminates hours of manual work**—developers are [automating Jira-to-Slack release communications](https://medium.com/@nubreed004/how-i-automated-release-notes-with-n8n-and-saved-hours-3c6c69f3b685), pulling ticket data, formatting updates, and posting to team channels automatically

These aren't theoretical case studies—they're real implementations by professionals who identified repetitive tasks and eliminated them with automation tools, often without writing a single line of traditional code.


The Method: Two Weeks That Change Everything
Your Immersive Timeline
This isn't a passive online course where you watch videos and hope for the best. This is 14.5 hours of intensive, hands-on transformation spread across two weeks, with support between sessions. This course is based on a proven formula that was tried and tested running australia's 3 [largest A.I. Hackathons](https://mlai.au/hackathon) with a total attendance of > 500.
Saturday, September 27th | 10:00 AM - 6:30 PM
The Foundation Day
We start with the big picture—understanding what AI actually is, what neural networks are, and why deployment isn't as scary as it sounds. Then we roll up our sleeves. Together, we'll build our first automation as a group with n8n, watching it come to life in real-time. By lunch (catered, naturally), you'll already be dangerous. The afternoon? That's when you identify the specific problem in your work that's been driving you crazy, and we help you start architecting your solution.
Tuesday, September 30th | 5:00 PM - 6:30 PM
First Reality Check
Three days in, you've been tinkering. You've hit walls. Perfect. This session is pure problem-solving—bringing your specific roadblocks to the group and leaving with clear paths forward. 
Thursday, October 2nd | 5:00 PM - 6:30 PM
Refinement Round
Your automation is taking shape. Now we polish it, optimize it, and make sure it's bulletproof enough for the real world.
Saturday, October 4th | 10:00 AM - 2:30 PM
Launch Day
The final push. Morning coding assistance ensures your automation is production-ready. Then we zoom out: understanding cybersecurity practices that keep your automations safe, exploring how AI is reshaping entire industries, and connecting you with your cohort's collective genius through team brainstorming. You leave with a working automation, a support network, and the confidence to build whatever comes next.
Beyond the Classroom
Every cohort becomes a living community. You'll join an exclusive group where members share wins, troubleshoot challenges, and discover new automation opportunities together. Plus, you gain access to our growing alumni network—hundreds of non-coders who've transformed their work and are eager to share what they've learned.

Frequently Asked Questions
"I'm genuinely not technical at all—I barely understand Excel. Can I really do this?"
Absolutely. We assume zero coding knowledge. There are thousands of examples online of non-coders building automatons that save hours of work each day (see [what you'll actually build]()) If you can use a web browser and describe a problem clearly, you have all the prerequisites you need.
"What if I get stuck after the course ends?"
You won't be on your own. Every cohort has a dedicated support group that remains active indefinitely.
"What software costs are involved after the course?"
The tools we teach (primarily n8n) have generous free tiers that cover most small business needs. If you scale up, paid plans start at around $20/month—a fraction of what you'll save in time during your first week of automation.
"How quickly will I see ROI on this investment?"
It's reasonable to expect that you can automate 3+ hours of work each week after taking this course. At typical professional rates, you'll recoup your investment in under a month.
"What happens if I can't attend a session?"
In person attendance is strongly recommended for both saturday sessions. If you can't make both sessions consider leaving the ticket for someone else until you find yourself in a position where you can set aside time.

The Moment: Why Now?
This Window Won't Stay Open Forever
The gap between those who can harness AI and those who can't is widening every day. But right now—this exact moment—is unique. The tools are finally accessible enough for non-coders to use, but most people don't know it yet. You have a chance to get ahead of the curve before automation becomes table stakes in every industry.
Limited to 15 participants. We keep classes small because transformation requires attention, not just information.
Early bird pricing ends soon. The first 8 registrants save $384—that's 43% off the standard rate.
Next cohort starts September 27th. The following cohort won't run until 2026.

Take the First Step
Stop letting repetitive tasks steal your precious life. Stop waiting for someone else to solve your problems. Stop accepting "that's just how we do things" as an answer.
In two weeks, you'll go from automation curious to automation capable. You'll have a working system saving you hours every week. You'll have a network of peers pushing the boundaries alongside you. Most importantly, you'll have the confidence and skills to build whatever solution your work demands.
The revolution in how software gets built has already begun. The only question is whether you'll be part of it.
