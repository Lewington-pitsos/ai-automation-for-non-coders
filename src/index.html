                        <p class="body-text">This course takes a <span class="white">different approach</span>.

They know which exceptions break the system, which edge cases matter, and what actually needs to be solved and with the help of cutting edge A.I. tools they can solve the issues themselves. This <span class="white">eliminates the translation layer</span> where most automation projects fail.</p>

Many years ago he was asked to build software to manage the pump on an oil derrick. He worked for <span class="white">6 months</span>, the oil company was happy with him, they thanked him, paid him a reasonable wage and sent him on his way.</p>
                        
                        <p class="body-text">Then <span class="white">8 months later</span> the company needed to make a change to the software. It was only then that they realised that there was <span class="white">only one person on this green earth</span> who knew how to make that change, and it was at that exact time that my classmate's dad decided his hourly rate had just <span class="white">increased 5,000 odd percent</span>.</p>
