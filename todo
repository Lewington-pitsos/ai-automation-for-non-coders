at the moment we track the registrations event. we want to track two versions of this, registrations for the course and registrations for the livestream.

both will be meta conversions registration events but with different parameters so we can distinguish them.



---
remove the registration page from the course alltogether. we will only have the apply page.

this means removing any javascript for that form as well

and remove any tests for that form

---

the livestream-handler should be renamed to application_handler and we need to update all references to it accordingly
