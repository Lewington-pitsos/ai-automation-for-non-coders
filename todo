when a user registers for the course they will be taken to a stripe payment page to pay for the course

once they have paid successfully an email will be sent from gday@fairdinkumsystems.com to their email with a welcome message thanking them and letting them know they will receive another email with their login details within 24 hours.

it will also tell them that if they want to get started right away they should watch this fun 9 minute video which captures on a high level how A.I.s learn https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9OHn5ZF4Uo&ab_channel=CGPGrey and this one on how to user N8n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy1UCBcgF2o&ab_channel=CharlieChang

it should also tell them to arrive 10 minutes early for the 2 in person sessions on the 27th and 4th of october as we kick off at 1000 sharp and they will need to be let into the building.

Also tell them that the exact address will be sent shortly and that they need to bring:

- a laptop
- a charger
- no lunch since it will be catered

their data once they have paid must be added to a dynamodb database table called "course_registrations"

an email should also be sent to lewingtonpitsos@gmail.com

describe the AWS architecture needed to make this happen
