at the moment we track the registrations event. we want to track two versions of this, registrations for the course and registrations for the livestream.

both will be meta conversions registration events but with different parameters so we can distinguish them.

- do some refactoring

> we need to change the registration form to an application form. 

  the way this will work is (1) the user fills out the application

  (2) it gets saved as a registration, but with a status of "applied"

  (3) we send an email to thank them for applying and let them know we will be in touch

  (4) on our end we review the application and either accept or reject it.

  (5) there is then a new lambda or an endpoint on an existing lambda where we pass it the id of an application in the database and it 

      (1) moves them to pending rather than applied
      (2) sends a notification to the user congratulating them on making it into the course along with a link to the registration page which using url parameters auto fills in most of the fields 

  the current registration page will be removed from the header, and instead we will have an "apply" button which goes to the application form.

  the same with all the cta buttons, they now go to the application form.

  the registration form is still there though, just nothing links to it. people can still find it if they want to.
   do not make any chnages yet, just plan what changes you will make
