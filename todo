the code is messily laid out. put all the website frontend code (around index.html) in a folder called src,

favicon

---

when we are in mobile mode alter the timeline so that the green bar and the associated dots no longer show. instead the cards take up the whole screen width

---

now the frontend needs to take this into account, when the response comes back if this error is what we see, an orange toast needs to show saying "that email has already been used to register for this course, please use another one or contact support (with a link to the contact page)". this toast will not go away until dismissed.

---

we need to keep track of the number of paid registrations (paid! only ones that have been confirmed and paid) in the database for the course 01_ai_automation_for_non_coders

We want to create a new endpoint which tells us the course status, it takes the course id

this includes:
- current paid sign ups
- current sign ups total
- course limit a constant number 15

the frontend pings this endpoint as soon as the page has loaded, and if the course is full we show a "sold out" message in a triangular green banner at the top of the page

we also make it so that when a registration button is clicked, it flashes orange and says "sold out" instead

We also disable all the form fields on the registration page, the user cannot enter anything.

issue where banner is sometimes gone
