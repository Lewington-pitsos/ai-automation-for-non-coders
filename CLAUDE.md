all styles go in styles.css
styles cannot be inline
all javascript goes in scripts.js except for the perlin noise background which goes in perlin-background.js

## styling
we only use black, white, gray and sometimes, very rarely for highlights, a green color on the website
corners are ALWAYS sharp

## deployment

Never deploy any terraform. stop and ask the user to do it for you.

## debugging

When asked to explain why something is happening ALWAYS find the EXACT line of code which is responsible. You may need to run your own tests to find out for sure.
